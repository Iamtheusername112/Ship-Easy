### Database Schema:
Already exists in `supabase/migrations/00001_initial_schema.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  type notification_type NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  payload JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  read_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_user ON notifications(user_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_unread ON notifications(user_id, read) WHERE read = false;
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Custom Notification:

```javascript
import { createNotification } from '@/utils/createNotification';

await createNotification({
  userId: 'user-uuid',
  type: 'shipment_created',
  title: 'New Shipment',
  message: 'Your shipment SE123456 has been created',
  payload: {
    tracking_code: 'SE123456',
    shipment_id: 'shipment-uuid'
  }
});
```

### Using Helper Functions:

```javascript
import { 
  notifyShipmentCreated,
  notifyDelivered 
} from '@/utils/createNotification';

// Notify customer about new shipment
await notifyShipmentCreated(customerId, trackingCode, recipientName);

// Notify delivery
await notifyDelivered(customerId, trackingCode);
```

### Using the Hook:

```javascript
import { useNotifications } from '@/hooks/useNotifications';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    notifications, 
    unreadCount, 
    markAsRead, 
    markAllAsRead 
  } = useNotifications();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You have {unreadCount} unread notifications</p>
      <button onClick={markAllAsRead}>Mark all as read</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
